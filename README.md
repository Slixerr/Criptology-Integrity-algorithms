# Criptology-algorithms

Algorithms were developed in Python for the Cryptology and Security Data class during my Master's Degree. Python is the programming language used, and Pandas is imported to generate the result tables.

You can find the full analysis of the algorithms in the PDF file within this repository (in Spanish).

This assignment has been graded by the teacher, receiving a score of 10.

The mentioned algorithms and their variations are as follows:

Yuval: Obtain a similar text with the same hash to falsify the intention of the original text.
1.2) Yuval splitting into X dictionaries by the number of iterations.
1.3) Yuval splitting into X dictionaries by the maximum size in GB of the dictionary.

Rainbow Table: Instead of computing hashes on-the-fly during an attack, a rainbow table stores precomputed hashes for a large number of possible inputs. This allows attackers to quickly look up the hash values and find corresponding plaintext passwords.
2.1) Rainbow table numeric.
2.2) Rainbow table letters.
